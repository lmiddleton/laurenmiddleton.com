      <h2>Lauren K. Middleton</h2>

    </p>

    <p>Lauren Middleton is an artist based in Waltham, Massachusetts who uses limited color palettes and organic shapes to explore the psychology of suspended emotion, ardent memory, and life/death/life cycles. Her recent work combines painting and procedurally-generated elements borrowed from the digital space to capture an abstracted foliage-sky scape.</p>

    <p>Lauren has completed artist residencies in Paris and Mandelieu-la-Napoule, France as well as New Mexico, USA. She currently occupies a studio at the Ira B. Gordon Center for the Arts in Waltham, MA as a member of the River Street Artists collective. Lauren received her BFA in Studio Arts with a concentration in Painting from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>
